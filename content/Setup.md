# Setup

I use three devices: big chonky desktop, MacBook Air M2 and iPad (9th gen).
For Programming I use my MacBook or the desktop, with Emacs as my text editor.
I take notes on my iPad, then convert some information from them
into these nice posts on the [[Digital Garden]] (See More in [[Workflow]]).

## Desktop

I am running Arch Linux as my operating system. I like it because it's lightweight,
and has newest package versions (most of the time). My window manager of choice is XMonad,
I also have KDE Plasma installed because it's my favourite [[Desktop Environment]].
The desktop is connected to two displays, one placed horizontally and one vertically.

### Specs

- CPU: Intel i5-8400
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti
- Memory: 8GB
- 1TB storage (512GB SSD, 512GB HDD)

I would list other specs, but I do not think they are important or I don't remember them.

## MacBook Air M2

I am doing most of my web browsing and web related projects and [[Markdown]]
note writing on my MacBook, mainly because it's more convenient,
If I am going to write a quick note on binary search or change a single div
I don't want to boot up the desktop. Apart from that
doing these, while I am in my bed is so much more comfortable.

## iPad

I am doing most of my handwritten note taking on my iPad, and I do a lot of that.
My school notes are written on my iPad and then, if deemed worthy, converted into [[Markdown]]
notes and published here. I am also doing all of my homework on it, because most of my homework
needs to be handwritten.

## Emacs

I think this deserves it's own subsection of this page. I am working on refactoring
and cleaning up my config when I am finished, it will be published here.
