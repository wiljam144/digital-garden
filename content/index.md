# Home

Welcome to my [[Digital Garden]]. I'm a student from Poland.
This website is a collection of random knowledge
and some notes from my lectures. Some of my experiments are also included/documented
in here. I'm still working on getting a functional note-relation graph
view in here and a proper navigation. The site's look and aesthetic are prone to changes.
At this moment you can use the search functionality to find what you want.

## Changelog
