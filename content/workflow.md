# Workflow

My workflow is actually two workflows, one is for
anything that happens when I'm on campus, and the
second one is when I'm home and have access to my MacBook
or PC.

## Campus

I more often than not, only take my iPad with me, when I'm not home.
So I only have access to my notebooks in GoodNotes 5.
Apart from that I usually leave so early that I don't have time
to open my MacBook or PC to write my agenda or anything like that.
Because of that I created a template for a special notebook in GoodNotes.
It consists of two columns, one for my daily agenda, and the second one,
for things that I discovered and want to do further research on and
write a note on my [[Digital Garden]] about it.

## Home

When I'm home I usually do my work on my PC or my MacBook.
I code and write notes for my [[Digital Garden]] on these devices,
and on both of them I use [[Emacs]] to do these tasks.
On my PC I use [[XMonad]] as my [[Window Manager]] in conjunction with
[[Polybar]] as my [[Top Bar]]. I plan to eventually clean up
configs for both of them, and publish them here.
